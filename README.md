Effective Denoising in Music-Present Pubs with Efficient Channel Attention

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Music denoising in noisy environments such as pubs, streets, and concerts is a challenging task due to overlapping noise frequencies. Traditional methods struggle to preserve the original music quality while removing background noise effectively.

This project introduces MusicBsECA, a novel music denoising model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) with a band-splitting approach. By leveraging LSTM and Transformer architectures, our method enhances both local and global dependencies, ensuring superior performance in real-world noisy environments.

ðŸ›  Key Features
Band-Splitting Mechanism: Decomposes the signal into sub-bands for precise noise separation.
Efficient Channel Attention (ECA): Focuses on key features to reduce computational complexity.
LSTM & Transformer Networks: Captures temporal and global dependencies for improved audio restoration.
Superior Performance: Outperforms existing methods like Wave-U-Net and BSRNN in noisy settings.
